summary: Group Based Policy
description:
  Group-Based Policy (GBP) is an API framework for OpenStack
  that offers an intent-driven model intended to describe
  application requirements in a way that is independent of
  underlying infrastructure. Rather than offer network-centric
  constructs like Layer 2 domains, GBP introduces a generic
  “Group” primitive along with a policy model to describe
  connectivity, security, and network services between groups.
  To date, while GBP has focused on the networking domain, it
  ultimately can be a generic framework that extends beyond
  networking as well.

  GBP runs as a service plugin within the Neutron process space
  but in the future may be separated out to a separate server as
  it develops.
